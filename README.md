🚀 How to Start the Project
1️⃣ Open the project in your preferred code editor.
2️⃣ Open two terminals – one for the server folder and one for the client folder.
3️⃣ In the first terminal, navigate to the server folder and start the server using "node server.js"
You should see the message: "Server started on port: 4000 and database connected."
